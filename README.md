# easyVisit

Most corporations now require you to sign in and obtain a visitor's badge.  This application allows for visitors to your organization to use a computer interface to:

1. Select who they are visiting if that is public information or to type in the name of a less common visitee
2. Enter their visit information
3. Scan the QR Code on the back of their badge

This application is not yet complete, but proves some basic web technologies for supporting this kind of workflow.

The QR Code scanning software is available from here:
